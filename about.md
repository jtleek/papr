### About

<hr> 

This is the __papr__ app. Think of it as "[Tinder](https://www.gotinder.com/) for pre-prints". If you don't know what Tinder is, think of it as a web app for collecting gut-reactions to pre-prints from the scientific community. For the moment the app only displays papers on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/), but if there is demand we may consider adding other pre-print servers as well.

#### Your data and research

When you sign in and swipe with papr we store a two things: 

-  An ananomized user id.
-  Your decisions on the abstracts you swiped.  

We will be using this data (in future releases) to help figure out what type of papers you like. Knowing this information will allow us to show you papers that are more revelent to your interests but also will let you find other researchers that are most like you (if you choose to make your identity known to the app). A kind of academic sphere of interest. 

We collect information on your ratings of academic papers on biorxiv through this service. These data may be analyzed and released in anonymized form. We will not release data labeled with your social media or gmail accounts. However, you should be aware that it may be possible to identify you from your ratings of papers (we don't know we haven't tried).

#### Author

It was built by [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/), [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](http://lucymcgowan.com), and [Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me) as an example of the sort of thing we hope to build with the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab. If you want a web or mobile app prototyped, consider submitting an app idea for free prototyping at our [Prototyping Shop](http://jhudatascience.org/prototyping/).

#### Terms

This app is provided solely for entertainment of the scientific community and may be taken down at any time with no notice because Jeff gets tired of it. It is provided "as is" and is not guaranteed to do anything really. Use at your own risk and hopefully enjoy :).
